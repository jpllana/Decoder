# Decoder
This project is used to decode some entered value.

The idea is that if you write some not human readable text the decoder will make it readable. The encoding part is made by changing letters, characters, numbers to some different group of characters. Letter 'a' is encoded to '3A', letter 'b' to '77', letter 'c' to 'C280', etc. In the script.js file you will find the dictionary with the encoded characters.

For example if the text: 
"This is a decoder made using JavaScript.
Enjoy it!"

will be encoded to:
5F73747E2B747E2B3A2B7F70C280517F707D2B583A7F702B6E7E7463562B553AC2813A5DC2807D744C6F39154E637151C2842B746F45
